<p>Every Saturday, I run a workshop to teach fundamental web and data skills by working on real-world data 
journalism projects. We call our event Open Hack and our loose affiliation of aspiring creators and developers the <a href="http://chitowncoders.org">Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew</a>.</p>

<p>Our first major project was a <a href="http://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail">scraper to collect statistics about the Cook County Jail 
inmate population</a> that launched in November 2012. In March 2014, Maria Zamudio, Sarah Murray, and Brian Peterson published <a href="http://crime-punishment.smartchicagoapps.org/">Crime and Punishment Chicago</a>, a guide to data about the Chicago and Cook County criminal justice system, in collaboration with the Smart Chicago Collaborative.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/data-journalism-community-why-and-how-do-we-do-wor/">manifesto was published in Source</a>.</p>
